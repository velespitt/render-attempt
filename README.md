# Viewing STL files on GitHub

You can generate your own 3D contribute document too with [this link](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files#3d-file-viewer)

> [!WARNING]  
> Do not confuse GitHub's [STL rendering](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/working-with-files/using-files/working-with-non-code-files#3d-file-viewer) with its [SEAL rendering](https://github.com/leereilly/SEAL-renderer/blob/master/seal.gif).
